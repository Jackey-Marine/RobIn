## Introduction

We propose $\tt{RobIn}$, a robust Invariant-based physical attack detector that uses an offline robustification to derive the design parameters of the onboard detection, memorizes the impact of disturbances through past flight missions, and guides Adaptive CUSUM threshold selection to be more resilient to attacks and false alarms. This allows $\tt{RobIn}$ to maintain an optimized trade-off between the attack detection rate and the false alarm rate under the uncertainties of disturbances. For practical evaluations, we demonstrate the feasibility of detection using real UAVs. 

In this tutorial, we show that how to extract the $\tt{RobIn}$ with Auto-regressive (AR) modeling and how to detect attacks in disturbances scenarios.
